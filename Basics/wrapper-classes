Wrapper class is a set of classes that allows us to use primitive data types as objects.

Since Java is an object-oriented language, there are situations where you need to work with objects rather than primitives,such as when using collections
(e.g., ArrayList, HashMap), which only work with objects.
Wrapper classes allow you to convert primitives into objects and vice versa.

Primitive Data Type	    Wrapper Class
byte	                  Byte
short                  	Short
int                    	Integer
long                  	Long
float                  	Float
double	                Double
char	                  Character
boolean                	Boolean


Utility Methods:

Wrapper classes provide utility methods for converting between primitives and strings, parsing strings, and performing other operations. For example:
Integer.parseInt(String s)  //converts a string to an int.
Integer.toString(int i)     //converts an int to a string
