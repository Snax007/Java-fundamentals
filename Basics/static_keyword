public class Player {
    String name;                // Instance variable (unique to each player)
    static int playerCount = 0; // Static variable (shared by all players)

    public Player(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        playerCount++;          // Increments for every new object
    }
}


NOTE :-
When i change the value of static variable , it is changed across the program
