JVM is the execution engine - it runs Java bytecode, handles memory management through the heap, performs JIT compilation, and enables 'write once, run anywhere.'

JRE is the runtime environment - it's the JVM plus core libraries (java.lang, java.util) that provide the minimum needed to run Java applications.

JDK is the development toolkit - it includes the JRE plus development tools like javac (compiler), javadoc, debuggers, and profilers needed to create Java applications.

So simply: JDK contains JRE, JRE contains JVM."
