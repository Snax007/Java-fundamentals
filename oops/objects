EXAMPLE:-
computer obj = new computer();

computer (first occurrence)

This is the data type or class name
Tells the compiler: "I'm creating a variable that will hold a computer object"
Significance: Provides type safety - obj can only reference computer objects

2. obj

This is the variable name or reference variable
It's an identifier you choose to refer to your object
Like a label or handle to access the object
Significance: Without this name, you couldn't interact with the object you're creating

3. = (assignment operator)

Assigns the newly created object to the variable obj
Connects the reference variable on the left to the actual object on the right
Significance: Links your variable name to the actual memory location of the object

4. new

A keyword that allocates memory for the object
Creates an actual instance of the computer class in memory (on the heap)
Calls the constructor to initialize the object
Significance: Without new, you'd just have a reference pointing to nothing (null)

5. computer() (second occurrence)

This calls the constructor of the computer class
The parentheses may contain arguments if the constructor accepts parameters
Initializes the object's properties/state
Significance: Sets up the initial state of your object
